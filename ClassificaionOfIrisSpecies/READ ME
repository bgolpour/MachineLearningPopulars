Because we have measurements for which we know the correct species of iris, this is a
supervised learning problem. In this problem, we want to predict one of several
options (the species of iris). This is an example of a classification problem. The possible
outputs (different species of irises) are called classes. Every iris in the dataset
belongs to one of three classes, so this problem is a three-class classification problem.
The desired output for a single data point (an iris) is the species of this flower. For a
particular data point, the species it belongs to is called its label.
